# SurfaceGrinding

My intial interest of code grew out of an inability to properly analyze a surface grinding operation in excel. This particular grinder
had a few anamolies that prevented a standard analysis. While the code was not used for the analysis, it provided the intial interest in Python.
Additionally, it was used as testbed to further my understand of Python for use in my other projects.
